\section{Introduction}
Depression is one of the most related mental diseases in the world. Some people call it the century illness due to its dangerousness. It can lead, in extreme situations, to suicide \cite{AmericanPsychiatryAssociationApa2013}. World Health Organization (WHO) presents a number of around 300 million people from different ages who suffer some kind of depression\footnote{www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders}. Some of these symptoms are, for example, depressed mood in most of the day, lost of interest in regular activities, weight loss, and insomnia.
% Sometimes depression is wrongly understood as a emotional state which reflects sadness. Independently of above examples, the fact is that the mental disease depression is wrongly defined and acknowledged.
% Depression is one of the most related mental disease in the world and some people call it as the century illness. World Health Organization (WHO) presents a number of around 300 million people from different ages who suffer some kind of depression \footnote{www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders}. 
In Brazil, the Health Ministry presents a number of 11,5 million people who are affected by depression\footnote{www.blog.saude.gov.br/index.php/materias-especiais/52516-mais-de-onze-milhoes-de-brasileiros-tem-depressao}.

Depression is classified on 11th international Disease Classification (ICD 11) as a disease when it is diagnosed in someone behavior. Depression can be triggered by an event where the person has lost something e.g. job, some close person etc.
This disease is also dangerous in order of its extreme consequences. Depression, according to ICD 11, can lead to suicide ideation and consequently to suicide \cite{AmericanPsychiatryAssociationApa2013}.

With the wide spread and with more people with depression, it becomes a challenge identify a person who can be in a real state of depression. Depression also afflicts people who are in specific location where the access to a professional is \textbf{costly impending}. Thus, identify and attend someone who could be a potential depressive patient, in a fast and unobtrusive way, seems very helpful.

With more affected people, it becomes a challenge to identify a person who can be in a real state of major depression disease. It also afflicts people who are in a specific location where access to a professional is hindered due to cost. Thus, it is helpful to recognize and attend someone who could be a potential depressive patient, in a fast and unobtrusive way.

In the context of online diagnosis, \textit{infodemiology} and \textit{digital disease detection} are correlated terms to describe the use of digital platforms and tools to improve society health. They can be translated as efforts to tackle epidemics detection, identify individuals at risk, and communicate candidate urgent illness. The use of technology could directly support institutions, professionals, and even to aid people to make themselves aware of some disease \cite{Horvitz}.%, in order to allow aware inside society. In that way, people could be aware about some disease and its implications.

Psychology already has methods to deal with depression identification. One of these methods is interview with psychologist. Through this conversation it could be possible to the professional, find some clues to identify someone with depression symptoms.

% The abstraction of that is the question, how someone express himself? Some people might express through text, others will prefer with music, others will prefer to not externalize some feelings and sentiments about himself. This makes the task of identification more challenge.
% Nowadays, some groups of people have demonstrated an interesting behaviour. The act of express itself has been demonstrated on social media. People have express themselves more on these online platforms.  

Social media has been employed on academia to monitor people's behaviour and their personal choices. With this in mind, sounds interesting to investigate if it is possible to identify signs, symptoms of depressive behaviour on social media platforms.

As said above, the task of identifying some disease, even if it is not depression, can be challenging. Due to the plant offers of data types, select what is the most effective, precise and reliable technique, method analysis could require a great quantity of time of research.

We can abbreviate our effort as the following question: \textbf{\emph{Is it possible to identify psychological diseases symptoms from people who are social media users?}}

% . Recorte de interacoes de pessoas com sintomas de depressao em mídias sociais
% . Grupo de trabalhos sobre métricas e metodos de análise
% Our research questions can be described as follow
% \textit{It would be possible to identify psychological diseases symptoms using social media?}
% . Seria possivel identificar sintomas de doencas psicologicas por meio das midias sociais?	 
% Is there a disturb diagnosis method only using data from social media?
The sentence above generically abstracts the firts indagations. As the texts goes along, we gradativally insert new questions to the original one.
Therefore, in the sections below we try to systemathize in a shape of research the effort to understand depression phenomena. How it affects people on social media, and whether is possible to identify a behaviour from someone depressive, are these behaviours similar over some point of view? 

The folowing question presents a primer effort to systematize a literature review and also a first understanding of the selected literature. Section \ref{sec:proposal} presents the tackkling proposal of the phenomena. In Section \ref{sec:experiments} we present first results of experiments and its related methodology. Finally, at Section \ref{sec:expect_contribution} we conclude with expected contributions for this thesis research

\section{Depression on Social Media}\label{sec:depression_SM}
This section presents a selection of works who present the phenomena from a physical and psychology perspective on Section \ref{subsec:definitions}. But also from a computing point of view on Section \ref{subsec:srl}.

\subsection{Disease Definitions}\label{subsec:definitions}
As a first step in order to investigate the problem of identification of depressive people on social media.

\textbf{Here I should write the definitions from psychological papers and books}

\subsection{Systematic Review of Literature}\label{subsec:srl}
For the literature selection we have applied a systematic literature review \textbf{(SLR)} in order to have a deeper insight from the most actual research which tackles the depression diagnosis in social media. One of the advantages of this methodology is the papers selection reproductivity. Dessa maneira, permitimos uma maior transparencia ao trabalho ao mpermitir que qualquer pessoa que deseje repita os passos definidos nos protocolos de pesquisa.

\textbf{A FIGURE WITH THE RESEARCH PROTOCOL - TAKE FROM THE WEB TOOL.}

From a computational perspective, the problem of dealing with depression and social media can be understand as search for people who suffer the symptoms of depression. Using different methods to identify if someone have depression or not, or if some person have one of the symptoms of depression. A good amount of articles relies on natural language processing (NLP) to make a systemic analysis over the text in social media publications.

In \cite{Zhao:2018:TCM:3302425.3302501}, the authors have applied text classification technique using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify depression using text analysis. The authors in \cite{Nobles:2018:IIS:3173574.3173987} also have used neural networks in order to find patterns on periods when the risk of suicide attempt is increasing in SMS texts.

The work in \cite{Li2016} is a qualitative study that try to understand how is the behavior and reception of chinese population about depression. It is a qualitative study and differs from the prior ones.

De Choudhury is an author that we would like to highlight. She is one author who have developed many articles and researches about measurement of depression on social media context. Her works vary on some types of measurement and implications of depression in some contexts of affected persons. We will cite some of these works due to the importance and relevance of her effort to contribute to this area. In \cite{DeChoudhury:2013:SMM:2464464.2464480}, the authors start to analyze might afflicted people by depression. They have used crowdsourcing to obtain data from twitter by people who were clinically diagnosed with depression. With this data, they have constructed a corpus and created a probabilistic model. The trained model would be relevant to indicate if a not seen post indicates depression.
Similar to previous work, Tsugawa et al \cite{Tsugawa2015} have applied the same analysis. However the users were selected from Japan. They try to replicate the results from \cite{DeChoudhury:2013:SMM:2464464.2464480}.

In \cite{Park:2015:MDL:2675133.2675139}, they present how activities on Facebook are associated with the depressive states of users and how depressive moods.  Their goal was to raise awareness to depression at the university where the study was conducted.

On \cite{andalibi_sensitive_2017}, the authors explore self-disclosures posts in Instagram. In this article, the authors use posts from people who tagged their post with \#depression in order to understand what kinds of sensitive disclosures do people make on Instagram.

In \cite{Homan:2014:SSD:2531602.2531704}, %\textbf{Social Structure and Depression in TrevorSpace}
the authors bring an approach to understand what is the behaviour of users in TrevorSpace. TrevorSpace is a social media platform (social network site - SNS) where their users are people from LGBTQ. This platform aims to prevent and avoid suicide among these users community.
Even though suicide and depression can occur inside different groups and ages, the authors confirm that some groups can face this problem more frequently. The LGBTQ is assured to be one of these groups who face it.
The authors choice on that SNS is justified by completeness of the network. Usually the task of selecting a certain group from a general network or social media 'esbarra' on selecting properly the users related to analysis. Thus, 'split' not related users to the desired ones is a reflection needed task. In this paper the authors don't have this problem because the whole network and its users are from the studied analysis group.

The author in \cite{Vedula2017} conduct an observational study to understand the interactions between clinically depressed users and their ego-network when contrasted with a group of users without depression. They identify relevant linguistic and emotional signals from social media exchanges to detect symptomatic cues of depression.

In \cite{Yazdavar:2017:SAM:3110025.3123028}, authors incorporates temporal analysis of user-generated content on social media for capturing symptoms. They developed a statistical model which emulates traditional observational cohort studies conducted through online questionnaires by extracting and categorizing different symptoms of depression by modeling user-generated content in social media.

In \cite{Chen2018}, they detected eight basic emotions and calculated the overall intensity (strength score) of the emotions extracted from all past tweets of each user. After that, created a time series for each emotion of every user to generate a selection of descriptive statistics for these time series.

\section{Proposed Methodology}\label{sec:proposal}

The proposed methodology aims to combine concepts from computer science area, and from psychology topic area called psychometrics.
Our methodology can be divided in three stages and it is represented in Figure \ref{fig:my_label}. It has as premise a given dataset of publications in a social media platform (e.g. twitter, reddit, instagram, etc.), we should be capable to apply all the stages for any kind of social media.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.3]{Figures/method_1.png}
  \hspace{.5cm}
  \includegraphics[scale=.3]{Figures/method_2.png}\\
  \vspace{.2cm}
  \includegraphics[scale=.45]{Figures/method_3.png}
  \caption{Workflow stages for the proposed methodology}
  \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

As most of the presented articles in Section 2, we also intend to apply text analysis over the datasets, specifically the technique that we want to employ is topic identification. Based on the work of \cite{Nolasco2016}, we aim to first identify what are the main topics of each user in a social media platform.
After the topics identification, for each user, we could map the terms into a polarity graph.
The polarity graph could help to identify if the most used words and terms of a user tend to be positive or negative. Related work has shown that depressive people used to manipulate more negative words. This reflects the low self-vision that this group express of themselves.
With the polarity graphs of each user, in third stage we intend to analyze how these graph have evolved over the time. In this manner, we could be capable to check if someone discourse has been turned into more positive or negative.
This could help to better explain the phenomena of depression inside social media. The time series analysis seems to be important, given that someone is considered depressed if he has manifested a set of symptoms for a certain period of time.
Also, with the graph of topics, we can apply social network metrics to understand how the users are connected, and how the people around them are affected by their discourse or behavior.

In the psychological approach, we intend to apply well defined questionnaires from psychometrics area on users selected from the computational approach.
Psychometrics represent the theory and technique of measuring mental processes and it is applied in the fields of psychology and education. These questionnaires could be incorporated to social media users to corroborate the classification of potential users with depression.
% are basically two which are interesting to research more about, the use of social networks to model depression symptoms, and the use mapping of well-known questionnaires in a proper computational shape/method.

\section{Inital Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}

\section{Expected Contributions}\label{sec:expect_contribution}

This work still in development of methodology, with some ideas of analysis that could be made.
The expected contributions are related to computer science and psychology.
For the computer science, we expect that employing computational metrics like social network analysis and topic classification could support people to acquire a more proper understanding of how the phenomena of depression happen in social media, and also how the social media reflects the real life.
For the health research point of view (psychology, medicine), our approach could improve how the diagnosis of depression is performed. This could aid people with few resources to enjoy a better health by the use of technology.



% \section{Introduction}
% ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a
% consistent \LaTeX\ style for use across ACM publications, and
% incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality
% necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
% SIG-specific \LaTeX\ templates have been examined, and their unique
% features incorporated into this single new template.

% If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable
% guide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you
% have published with ACM before, this document provides insight and
% instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles
% for any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage
% of publication, from review to final ``camera-ready'' copy, to the
% author's own version, with {\itshape very} few changes to the source.

% \section{Template Overview}
% As noted in the introduction, the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can
% be used to prepare many different kinds of documentation --- a
% double-blind initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a
% two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a ``camera-ready''
% journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more --- all by
% selecting the appropriate {\itshape template style} and {\itshape
%   template parameters}.

% This document will explain the major features of the document
% class. For further information, the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide} is
% available from
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}.

% \subsection{Template Styles}

% The primary parameter given to the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class is
% the {\itshape template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication
% or SIG publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square
% brackets and is a part of the {\verb|documentclass|} command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}

% Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals
% use the {\verb|acmsmall|} template style:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\verb|acmsmall|}: The default journal template style.
% \item {\verb|acmlarge|}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.
% \item {\verb|acmtog|}: Used by TOG.
% \end{itemize}

% The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\verb|acmconf|} template style.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\verb|acmconf|}: The default proceedings template style.
% \item{\verb|sigchi|}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.
% \item{\verb|sigchi-a|}: Used for SIGCHI ``Extended Abstract'' articles.
% \item{\verb|sigplan|}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Template Parameters}

% In addition to specifying the {\itshape template style} to be used in
% formatting your work, there are a number of {\itshape template parameters}
% which modify some part of the applied template style. A complete list
% of these parameters can be found in the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide.}

% Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\verb|anonymous,review|}: Suitable for a ``double-blind''
%   conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line
%   numbers. Use with the \verb|\acmSubmissionID| command to print the
%   submission's unique ID on each page of the work.
% \item{\verb|authorversion|}: Produces a version of the work suitable
%   for posting by the author.
% \item{\verb|screen|}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
% \end{itemize}

% This document uses the following string as the first command in the
% source file:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Modifications}

% Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
% margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
% and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
% vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

% {\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if
%   modifications are discovered.}

% \section{Typefaces}

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
% ``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
% this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
% ``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
% as they will override the built-in typeface families.

% \section{Title Information}

% The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
% \url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
% capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
% your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
% {\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

% If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
% in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
% command has a ``short title'' parameter:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \title[short title]{full title}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Authors and Affiliations}

% Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
% identification. Multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors'
% names should not be abbreviated; use full first names wherever
% possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever possible.

% Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
% alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
%   \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
%   \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
% \end{verbatim}

% The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
% to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
% of an article contributed equally to the work.

% If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
% the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
% overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
% the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
% \end{verbatim}
% Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
% of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
% page headers.

% The article template's documentation, available at
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
% complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
% use.

% Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

% \section{Rights Information}

% Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
% form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
% made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,
% license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

% Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
% copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This
% form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source
% document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and
% their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final
% document:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
% \item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
% \item the conference information in the page header(s).
% \end{itemize}

% Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
% works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
% each of the works.

% The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one
% page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

% \section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

% Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
% taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
% search.

% The ACM Computing Classification System ---
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
% classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
% discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
% system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
% commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

% User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
% of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
% the research being presented.

% CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
% articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
% two-page articles (or abstracts).

% \section{Sectioning Commands}

% Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
% \verb|section|, \verb|subsection|, \verb|subsubsection|, and
% \verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
% from the commands.

% Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
% a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

% \section{Tables}

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
% package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
% high-quality tables.

% Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

% Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
% them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
% ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
% environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
% table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
% \textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
% columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
% detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
% \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
% placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
% this document.

% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%   \label{tab:freq}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
%     $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
%     \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
%     $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\

% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
% live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
% contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
% wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
% desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
% instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
% in the printed output of this document.

%     \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\

% \end{table*}

% \section{Math Equations}
% You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
% inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
% discussed in the next sections.

% \subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
% in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
% which can be invoked with the usual
% \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
% the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
% and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
% \LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
% examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
% \begin{math}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{math},
% set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
% set in display style.  (See next section).

% \subsection{Display Equations}
% A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
% text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
% environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
% \textbf{displaymath} environment.

% Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
% structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
% of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
% equation, shown as an inline equation above:
% \begin{equation}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{equation}
% Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
% the \textbf{displaymath}
% environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
% \begin{displaymath}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
% \end{displaymath}
% and follow it with another numbered equation:
% \begin{equation}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
% \end{equation}
% just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

% \section{Figures}

% The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
% more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
% third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
% in the example below.
% \begin{figure}[h]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
%   \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
%     Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
%     Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
%   \Description{The 1907 Franklin Model D roadster.}
% \end{figure}

% Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
% the reader. Figure captions go below the figure. Your figures should
% {\bfseries also} include a description suitable for screen readers, to
% assist the visually-challenged to better understand your work.

% Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

% \subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

% A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
% are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
% the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
% figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
% \verb|\maketitle| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{teaserfigure}
%     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
%     \caption{figure caption}
%     \Description{figure description}
%   \end{teaserfigure}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Citations and Bibliographies}

% The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
% references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
% --- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
% (``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
% reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
% article DOI, etc.

% The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
% commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%   \bibliography{bibfile}
% \end{verbatim}
% where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
% suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

% Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
% ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
% ``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
% command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before
% ``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
% \end{verbatim}

%   Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
%   enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
%   issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
%   monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
%   \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
%   \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
%   the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
%   Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
%   a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
%   divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
%   book \cite{Knuth97}, an article in a proceedings (of a conference,
%   symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings article)
%   \cite{Andler79}, a proceedings article with all possible elements
%   \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated proceedings article
%   \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a
%   doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis:
%   \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web resource
%   \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game (Case 1)
%   \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05} and
%   (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
%   publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
%   \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might
%   contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
%   \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton:
%   multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A
%   couple of citations with DOIs:
%   \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Online
%   citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}. Artifacts:
%   \cite{R} and \cite{UMassCitations}.

% \section{Acknowledgments}

% Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
% individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
% preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
% section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
% document.

% This section has a special environment:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{acks}
%   ...
%   \end{acks}
% \end{verbatim}
% so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
% during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
% consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

% Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

% \section{Appendices}

% If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
% ``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
% document.

% Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \appendix
% \end{verbatim}
% and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
% numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
% and subsection identification method.

% \section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

% The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
% not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
% a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
% ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
% the margin:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\verb|sidebar|}:  Place formatted text in the margin.
% \item {\verb|marginfigure|}: Place a figure in the margin.
% \item {\verb|margintable|}: Place a table in the margin.
% \end{itemize}

% %%
% %% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
% %% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
% %% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
% %% consistent spelling of the heading.
% \begin{acks}
% To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
% \end{acks}

%%
%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{mainReference}

%%
%% If your work has an appendix, this is the place to put it.
