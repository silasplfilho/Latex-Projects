abstract = {More than 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Major depressive disorder has a hugely negative impact on psychological well-being, work, and family life. Yet culture may shape how depressed patients interpret their symptoms, choose treatments, and behave. This paper reports a case study, including participant observations and interviews, of the Chinese online depression community, SunForum. Our findings reveal that Chinese cultural beliefs (e.g., the power of inner self-control) and Chinese beliefs about traditional medicine (e.g., the integrated body-mind relationship) significantly affect patients' understandings of depression, illness management, and social interactions. These beliefs create problems of understanding depression in society-including family members, friends, co-workers, and others-and present various challenges for depressed patients who can become marginalized, suffer discrimination, and lose their jobs. We draw implications for how Chinese society as a whole may respond to the misunderstanding of mental illness and the raising of public awareness. We also propose specific social media design to support depressed patients as they seek online information and social support.

abstract = {Depression is among the most commonly diagnosed mental disor-ders around the world. With the increasing popularity of online social network platforms and the advances in data science, more research efforts have been spent on understanding mental disor-ders through social media by analysing linguistic style, sentiment, online social networks and other activity traces. However, the role of basic emotions and their changes over time, have not yet been fully explored in extant work. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach for identifying users with or at risk of depression by incor-porating measures of eight basic emotions as features from Twitter posts over time, including a temporal analysis of these features. The results showed that emotion-related expressions can reveal insights of individuals' psychological states and emotions measured from such expressions show predictive power of identifying depression on Twitter. We also demonstrated that the changes in an individ-ual's emotions as measured over time bear additional information and can further improve the effectiveness of emotions as features, hence, improve the performance of our proposed model in this task.},

abstract = {Health outcomes in modern society are often shaped by peer in-teractions. Increasingly, a significant fraction of such interactions happen online and can have an impact on various mental health and behavioral health outcomes. Guided by appropriate social and psychological research, we conduct an observational study to under-stand the interactions between clinically depressed users and their ego-network when contrasted with a differential control group of normal users and their ego-network. Specifically, we examine if one can identify relevant linguistic and emotional signals from social media exchanges to detect symptomatic cues of depression. We ob-serve significant deviations in the behavior of depressed users from the control group. Reduced and nocturnal online activity patterns, reduced active and passive network participation, increase in nega-tive sentiment or emotion, distinct linguistic styles (e.g. self-focused pronoun usage), highly clustered and tightly-knit neighborhood structure, and little to no exchange of influence between depressed users and their ego-network over time are some of the observed characteristics. Based on our observations, we then describe an approach to extract relevant features and show that building a clas-sifier to predict depression based on such features can achieve an F-score of 90{\%}.},

abstract = {The birth of a child is a major milestone in the life of parents. We leverage Facebook data shared voluntarily by 165 new mothers as streams of evidence for characterizing their postnatal experiences. We consider multiple measures including activity, social capital, emotion, and linguistic style in participants' Facebook data in pre-and postnatal periods. Our study includes detecting and predicting onset of post-partum depression (PPD). The work complements recent work on detecting and predicting significant postpartum changes in behavior, language, and affect from Twitter data. In contrast to prior studies, we gain access to ground truth on postpartum experiences via self-reports and a common psychometric instrument used to evaluate PPD. We develop a series of statistical models to predict, from data available before childbirth, a mother's likelihood of PPD. We corroborate our quantitative findings through interviews with mothers experiencing PPD. We find that increased social isolation and lowered availability of social capital on Facebook, are the best predictors of PPD in mothers.},

abstract = {We explore the harnessing of social media as a window on changes around major life events in individuals and larger populations. We specifically examine patterns of activity, emotional, and linguistic correlates for childbirth and postnatal course. After identifying childbirth events on Twitter, we analyze daily posting patterns and language usage before and after birth by new mothers, and make inferences about the status and dynamics of changes in emotions expressed following childbirth. We find that childbirth is associated with some changes for most new mothers, but approximately 15{\%} of new mothers show significant changes in their online activity and emotional expression postpartum. We observe that these mothers can be distinguished by linguistic changes captured by shifts in a relatively small number of words in their social media posts. We introduce a greedy differencing procedure to identify the type of language that characterizes significant changes in these mothers during postpartum. We conclude with a discussion about how such characterizations might be applied to recognizing and understanding health and well-being in women following childbirth.},

As ground truth data, we use the results of a web-based questionnaire for measuring degree of depression of Twitter users. We extract several features from the activity histories of Twitter users. By leveraging these features, we construct models for estimating the presence of active depression. Through experiments, we show that (1) features obtained from user activities can be used to predict depression of users with an accuracy of 69{\%}, (2) topics of tweets estimated with a topic model are useful features, (3) approximately two months of observation data are necessary for recognizing depression, and longer observation periods do not contribute to improving the accuracy of estimation for current depression; sometimes, longer periods worsen the accuracy.},

abstract = {Large-scale aggregate analyses of anonymized data can yield valuable results and insights that address public health challenges and provide new avenues for scientific discovery. These methods can extend our knowledge and provide new tools for enhancing health and wellbeing. However, they raise questions about how to best address potential threats to privacy while reaping benefits for individuals and to society as a whole.The use of machine learning to make leaps across informational and social contexts to infer health conditions and risks from nonmedical data provides representative scenarios for reflections on directions with balancing innovation and regulation.},
