\section*{Introdução}

Depression is one of the most reported mental diseases in the world. Some people call it the century illness due to its dangerousness\footnote{www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/04/what-is-depression-and-why-is-it-rising}. 
The Global Burden of Disease indicates depressive disorders as the third lead cause of disability \cite{IHME}. From 1990, it was the fourth lead cause. 
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation depicts the progression of depression over the years as a stable disease\footnote{Reproducible on http://ihmeuw.org/51aj}, as confirmed also by \cite{brody2018prevalence}. However, as a contrast to this stability, depression afflicts more certain groups than others. Such as women to men, Europeans to Africans, and people with more income. É apresentado no Apêndice a Figura \ref{fig:depressionmap}, demonstrando essa estabilidade na evolução dos caos nos diferentes continentes.

% It can leads, in extreme situations, to suicide \cite{american2013diagnostic}. 
World Health Organization (WHO) presents that around 300 million people from different ages suffer from some level of depression\footnote{www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders}. 
Some of these symptoms are, for example, depressed mood in most of the day, loss of interest in regular activities, weight loss, and insomnia.
The Health Ministry in Brazil presents that 11.5 million people are affected by depression\footnote{www.blog.saude.gov.br/index.php/materias-especiais/52516-mais-de-onze-milhoes-de-brasileiros-tem-depressao}.

% With the wide spread, it becomes
It is a challenge to identify sick people in the early phase of depression. Someone depressive can face impediments like cost, social prejudice, and even a personal obstruction. Moreover, the reverse path is also a problem. Due to the great number of depression occurrences, it can be an obstacle for institutes and professionals to reach these who face a mental disease and its variants. \cite{Lech2014} highlights the urgency in early identification and prediction of depression and its symptoms due to the difficulties to detect these symptoms in initial stages. \cite{elkin2008america} presents that 34\% of health search is made on social media, and 59\% of adults look for health information on the internet.
Sometimes, due to the location or economical scenario,it is \textit{costly impending} to get help from one professional. 
\textit{Infodemiology} and \textit{digital disease detection} are correlated terms to describe the use of digital platforms and tools to improve social health. They can be translated as efforts to tackle epidemics, identify individuals at risk, and communicate candidate urgent illness. The use of technology directly supports institutions, professionals, and even aids people to make themselves aware of some diseases \cite{Horvitz}.
Social media has proved that people are using online platforms to publish their social interests and preferences to share with other users. 
Through social media, a user can connect to their friends, relatives, and even unknown ones. 
The content generated on these platforms looks like good sources of information that could help when dealing with disease detection or connection among a psychologist and one depressive patient.
Due to the described scenario above, to identify and attend someone who could be a potential depressive patient, in a fast and unobtrusive way, seems to be very helpful for both patient and professional.
The task of identifying some disease, even if it is not depression, can be challenging, but at the same time relevant to investigate if it is possible to identify signs, symptoms of depressive behavior on social media platforms.  
Due to the plenty of data offering, select what is the most effective, precise and representative data can be challenging. Therefore, choose a reliable technique and a consistent method analysis can require a great amount of research.

% \silas{Explicar qual o objetivo desse trabalho e o que ele abrange.}
This paper aims to propose a new method to identify depression symptoms in social media platforms. Relied on the literature review, we believe this proposal highlights a research approach that was not investigated extensively.
One initial research question can be defined as follows: \textbf{\emph{Is it possible to identify psychological diseases symptoms, more specifically depression symptoms, from social media users content?}} The research question generally reaches initial doubts. Novel questions will be noted as the research goes forward.
Although it is an in-progress research, with its stages and processes under validation, the following sections try to systematize the methodological steps to understand depression phenomena and how it affects people on social media.
Whether is possible to identify a behavior from someone depressive, are these behaviors similar over some point of view?

\section*{Trabalhos Correlatos}
The 11th International Disease Classification (ICD 11) classifies depression as a disease when it is diagnosed in someone’s behavior. An event where the person has lost something e.g. job, some close person, etc. could start depression symptoms. This disease is also dangerous because of its extreme consequences. Depression, according to ICD 11, can lead to suicide ideation and suicide as consequence\cite{american2013diagnostic}.
As a first step in order to investigate the problem of identification of depressive people on social media.

Although depression is the common name in society, the Manual of Mental Disorder Diagnostic (DSM-V) details different types of depression. The most common and more general is the major depressive disorder (MDD), though each variant of depression is covered by the term \textit{Depressive Disorder}. Alternatives of that kid of disorder are \textit{transtorno disruptivo da desregulação do humor}, \textit{transtorno depressivo persistente (distimia)} and \textit{transtorno disfórico pré-menstrual}. The DSM-V also lists the characteristics for diagnosis of each variant. We can list from MDD diagnosis criterias e.g. insomnia or over sleep, depressive mood in most part of the day, lost of interest in activities and weight loss. DSM-V also highlights that a group of at least 5 symptoms must occur in a time period of two weeks.
Depression symptoms and characteristics are very similar to Freud's description of melancholia \cite{freud1917mourning}. 

\subsection{Current Approaches}\label{subsec:srl}
For the literature selection, we have applied a systematic literature review \textbf{(SLR)} in order to have a deeper insight from the most recent research that tackles depression detection in social media. 
SLR allows to create protocols that can be reused by other researchers and therefore give to research transparency and reproducibility.
% It allows, whether the protocols are respected, 
This stage is under construction yet and it is intended to include two more bases. The SLR until this moment was done searching for articles in ACM and IEEE bases. It has been searched the string \textit{(``Social Media" OR ``Social Network" OR ``Complex Network" ) AND (Depression OR ``Major Depressive Disorder")}. Including only works from 2013 until 2018, from computing area which have used social media as a data source. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below in Table \ref{tab:rslCriterias}. At the final stage, there was a total number of 47 selected papers. There were 22 papers from ACM Library and 25 papers from IEEE Explore.

It may not seem clearly, but can be listed main objectives from read articles are: identify what symptoms are searchable in social media and will compose a model as features; create a model which classifies an unseen user as potential depressive or not. The problem of dealing with depression and social media can be understand as a search for people who suffer the symptoms of depression.

A good amount of articles relies on natural language processing (NLP) to make a systemic analysis over the text in social media publications. 
Not all the analyzed researches take into account the psychology point of view. The effect of taking into account existing approaches from psychology is that the analysis will be more robust and reliable since the psychology research area already addresses mental disease problems. It is a challenge align quantification made by metrics e.g. NLP, social network analysis and other techniques to the cognition of a psychologist on ordinary clinical treatment. 

\cite{DeChoudhury:2013:SMM:2464464.2464480} has developed many articles and researches about the measurement of depression in population using social media information. The authors in this work have been made use of psychometrics questionnaires. 
Psychometrics represents the theory and technique of measuring mental processes and it is applied in Psychology and Education. It is an interesting approach, although it is questionable due to how it simplifies the whole process of understanding someone's behavior.
In \cite{DeChoudhury:2013:SMM:2464464.2464480}, crowdsourcing is applied to obtain data from twitter by people who were clinically diagnosed with depression. With this data, they have constructed a corpus and developed a probabilistic model. The trained model classifies if a post indicates depression.
Similar to previous work, Tsugawa et al \cite{Tsugawa2015} have applied the same analysis to replicate the results in a group of users from Japan.

\cite{Park:2015:MDL:2675133.2675139} present how activities on Facebook are associated with depressive states of users in order to raise awareness to depression at the University where the study was conducted, which had seen an increase in the suicide rate of its students.
\cite{andalibi_sensitive_2017} explore self-disclosures posts in Instagram. In this article, the authors have used content from posts tagged with \#depression to understand what rather sensitive disclosures do people make on Instagram. The work in \cite{Li2016} is a qualitative study that tries to understand how is the behavior and comprehension of the Chinese population about depression. It is a qualitative study and differs from prior ones.
\cite{Vedula2017} conduct an observational study to understand the interactions between clinically depressed users and their ego-network when contrasted with a group of users without depression. They identify relevant linguistic and emotional signals from social media exchanges to detect symptomatic cues of depression.
\cite{Zhao:2018:TCM:3302425.3302501} have applied text classification using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify depression using text analysis. \cite{Nobles:2018:IIS:3173574.3173987} also have used neural networks to identify patterns on time periods when the risk of a suicide attempt is increasing in SMS texts.
\cite{Yazdavar:2017:SAM:3110025.3123028} incorporate temporal analysis of user-generated content on social media for capturing symptoms. They have developed a statistical model that emulates traditional observational cohort studies conducted through online questionnaires and extract and categorize different symptoms of depression and modeling user-generated content in social media.
\cite{Chen2018} detected eight basic emotions and calculated the overall intensity (strength score) of the emotions extracted from all past tweets of each user. After that, they have generated a time series for each emotion of every user in order to generate a selection of descriptive statistics for this time series.
% \silas{Paragraph below to highlight the aperture to investigate}

Papers cited above not always take into account how psychologists infer if someone is depressive or not. 
We also stress that many of the real contributions rely on textual information generated by one user. Since one of the depression symptoms in ICD 11 is the inactivity, we could question if a depressive one would consistently generate online content.
The context of psychology regularly deals with the subjectivity of information. Relied on that, we believe that relevant information can be extracted from other methods rather than text content. We believe that the classification of potential depressive users could be more reliable if combined with ``subjective information".

% %	VERTEBRATE ANIMALS
% %----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% \newpage

% \section*{10. Vertebrate Animals}

% If Vertebrate Animals are involved in the project, address each of the five points below. This section should be a concise, complete description of the animals and proposed procedures. While additional details may be included in the Research Strategy, the responses to the five required points below must be cohesive and include sufficient detail to allow evaluation by peer reviewers and NIH staff. If all or part of the proposed research involving vertebrate animals will take place at alternate sites (such as project/performance or collaborating site(s)), identify those sites and describe the activities at those locations. Although no specific page limitation applies to this section of the application, be succinct. Failure to address the following five points will result in the application being designated as incomplete and will be grounds for the PHS to defer the application from the peer review round. Alternatively, the application’s impact/priority score may be negatively affected.

% If the involvement of animals is indefinite, provide an explanation and indicate when it is anticipated that animals will be used. If an award is made, prior to the involvement of animals the grantee must submit to the NIH awarding office detailed information as required in points 1-5 above and verification of IACUC approval. If the grantee does not have an Animal Welfare Assurance then an appropriate Assurance will be required (See Part III, Section 2.2 Vertebrate Animals for more information).
% The five points are as follows:

% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item Provide a detailed description of the proposed use of the animals in the work outlined in the Research Strategy section. Identify the species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers of animals to be used in the proposed work.
% 	\item Justify the use of animals, the choice of species, and the numbers to be used. If animals are in short supply, costly, or to be used in large numbers, provide an additional rationale for their selection and numbers.
% 	\item Provide information on the veterinary care of the animals involved.
% 	\item Describe the procedures for ensuring that discomfort, distress, pain, and injury will be limited to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research. Describe the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices, where appropriate, to minimize discomfort, distress, pain, and injury.
% 	\item Describe any method of euthanasia to be used and the reasons for its selection. State whether this method is consistent with the recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines on Euthanasia. If not, include a scientific justification for not following the recommendations.
% \end{enumerate}

% Do not use the vertebrate animal section to circumvent the page limits of the Research Strategy.

% %----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% \newpage

% \section*{13. Consortium/Contractual Arrangements}

% Explain the programmatic, fiscal, and administrative arrangements to be made between the applicant organization and the consortium organization(s). If consortium/contractual activities represent a significant portion of the overall project, explain why the applicant organization, rather than the ultimate performer of the activities, should be the grantee. The signature of the Authorized Organization Representative on the SF424 (R\&R) cover component (Item 17) signifies that the applicant and all proposed consortium participants understand and agree to the following statement:

% \emph{The appropriate programmatic and administrative personnel of each organization involved in this grant application are aware of the agency's consortium agreement policy and are prepared to establish the necessary inter-organizational agreement(s) consistent with that policy.}

% %	RESOURCE SHARING
% %----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% \newpage

% %   \section*{14. Letters of Support} - letters to attach
% \section*{15. Resource Sharing}

% NIH considers the sharing of unique research resources developed through NIH-sponsored research an important means to enhance the value and further the advancement of the research. When resources have been developed with NIH funds and the associated research findings published or provided to NIH, it is important that they be made readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community. See Part III, 1.5 Sharing Research Resources.

% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item{Data Sharing Plan:} Investigators seeking \$500,000 or more in direct costs (exclusive of consortium F\&A) in any year are expected to include a brief 1-paragraph description of how final research data will be shared, or explain why data-sharing is not possible. Specific Funding Opportunity Announcements may require that all applications include this information regardless of the dollar level. Applicants are encouraged to read the specific opportunity carefully and discuss their data-sharing plan with their program contact at the time they negotiate an agreement with the Institute/Center (IC) staff to accept assignment of their application. See Data-Sharing Policy or http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice- files/NOT-OD-03-032.html.
% 	\item{Sharing Model Organisms:} Regardless of the amount requested, all applications where the development of model organisms is anticipated are expected to include a description of a specific plan for sharing and distributing unique model organisms or state why such sharing is restricted or not possible. See Sharing Model Organisms Policy, and NIH Guide NOT-OD-04-042.
% 	\item{Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS):} Applicants seeking funding for a genome-wide association study are expected to provide a plan for submission of GWAS data to the NIH-designated GWAS data repository, or an appropriate explanation why submission to the repository is not possible. GWAS is defined as any study of genetic variation across the entire genome that is designed to identify genetic associations with observable traits (such as blood pressure or weight) or the presence or absence of a disease or condition. For further information see Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies, NIH Guide NOT-OD-07-088, and http://grants.nih.gov/grants/gwas/.
